Peaks in the spectral flux of an audio signal indicate onsets in the signal. The algorithm I worked on uses a measure similar to the spectral flatness measure in order to normalize the spectral flux of the audio signal. Normalization of the spectral flux is necessary for peak picking.

I also applied this algorithm to adaptive window size selection for a more accurate time-frequency representation of audio signals.

I worked on this project as part of my research internship at Delhi Technological University in 2017.
