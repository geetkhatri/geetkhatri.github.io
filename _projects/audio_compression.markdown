The algorithm, which is based on MPEG AAC, minimizes the perceived distortion due to compression. This distortion is related to the quantization noise over frequency sub-bands. A statistical model of the quantization noise is used for computation of the optimal scalefactors for sub-bands, which is a key step in the algorithm.
