My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and signal processing. Iâ€™m particularly interested in their application to problems in audio and medicine. My [past research and project work](/projects) was primarily focused on speech enhancement, AI-based battery modeling, and ultrasonic flaw detection.

Currently, I'm a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. Previously, I worked as a software engineer in Pune, India. Prior to that, I was in Delhi Technological University, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Some of my other interests are music, independent film, and art. I write and produce music under the moniker [Mauveine C.](https://mauveinec.bandcamp.com/){:target="\_blank"} (FKA Taryn), and formerly played guitar for Raleigh-based band My Sister Maura.
