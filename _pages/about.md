I'm a prospective graduate student with an interest in signal processing and machine learning. My research interests include speech enhancement and compressive sensing as well as application of machine learning to problems such as speech recognition, natural language processing and source separation. My [research and project work](/projects) so far has been primarily focused on speech enhancement, audio compression and onset detection in audio signals. 

Currently, I'm working as a software engineer at UBS in Pune, India. My work involves data analysis and software development for Wealth Management USA. Prior to that, I was in Delhi Technological University, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Some of my other interests are music, independent film and math. I write and produce music, which is available [here](https://tarynn.bandcamp.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
