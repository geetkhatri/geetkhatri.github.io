My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and signal processing. Iâ€™m particularly interested in their application to problems in computer vision, energy, and audio. My [past research and project work](/projects) was primarily focused on AI-based battery modeling, ultrasonic flaw detection, and speech enhancement.

Currently, I'm a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. Previously, I worked as a software engineer in Pune, India. Prior to that, I was in Delhi Technological University, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Some of my other interests are music, independent film, and art. I write and produce music under the moniker [Taryn](https://tarynn.bandcamp.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I also play guitar for the Raleigh-based band [My Sister Maura](https://www.instagram.com/mysistermaura/){:target="\_blank"}.
