 I'm an Electrical Engineering PhD student in the [Active Robotic Sensing (ARoS) Lab](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/){:target="\_blank"} at NC State University. My research interests include machine learning and signal processing for problems in medicine and audio.
 
The focus of my current research is on developing machine learning models for wearable devices and biosensors, with an emphasis on interpretability, trustworthiness and privacy. The specific applications I'm working on include speech-based dementia detection, histone biosensor modeling, and anomaly detection for physiological signals. In the past, I've worked on speech enhancement, lossy audio compression, AI-based battery modeling, and ultrasonic flaw detection.

Before joining NC State, I worked as a software engineer in Pune, India. Prior to that, I was in Delhi Technological University, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Some of my other interests are music, film and photography. I write and produce music under the moniker [Mauveine C.](https://mauveinec.bandcamp.com/){:target="\_blank"} (FKA Taryn).
