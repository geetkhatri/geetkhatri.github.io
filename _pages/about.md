 I'm an Electrical Engineering PhD student in the [Active Robotic Sensing (ARoS) Lab](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/){:target="\_blank"} at North Carolina State University. My research interests include machine learning and signal processing. I’m particularly interested in their application to problems in medicine and audio.
 
Currently, I’m working on speech and language processing for tracking speech disorders, and machine learning for wearable biosensors. My past research and project work was primarily focused on speech enhancement, AI-based battery modeling, and ultrasonic flaw detection.

Before joining NC State, I worked as a software engineer in Pune, India. Prior to that, I was in Delhi Technological University, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Some of my other interests are music, independent film, and art. I write and produce music under the moniker [Mauveine C.](https://mauveinec.bandcamp.com/){:target="\_blank"} (FKA Taryn).
