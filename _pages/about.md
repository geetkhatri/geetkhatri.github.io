I'm a prospective graduate student with an interest in signal processing and machine learning. My research interests include speech enhancement and audio compression as well as application of machine learning to problems such as speech recognition, natural language processing, source separation and music information retrieval. My research and project [work](/projects) so far has been primarily focused on speech enhancement, audio compression and onset detection in audio signals. 

Currently, I'm working as a software engineer at UBS in Pune, India. My work involves data analysis and software development for Wealth Management USA. Prior to that, I was in Delhi Technological University where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

My other interests include music, independent cinema and math. I produce music under the moniker [Taryn](https://tarynn.bandcamp.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
